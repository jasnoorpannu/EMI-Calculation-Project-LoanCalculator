## EMI Calculation Project: LoanCalculator

### Project Introduction

Welcome to the **EMI Calculation Project**! This project, developed in Java, provides a comprehensive tool for calculating and managing loan repayments. It is designed to assist users in understanding their financial commitments by computing the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) and determining the loan tenure based on various payment frequencies.

### Features

1. **Date Initialization**:
   - The program begins by displaying the current date, formatted in `dd-MM-yyyy`, ensuring users have a time-stamped reference for their calculations.

2. **Task Selection**:
   - Users can choose between calculating the EMI or determining the loan tenure based on a fixed EMI. This provides flexibility for both prospective and current borrowers.

3. **Payment Frequency Options**:
   - The application supports multiple payment frequencies, including:
     - **Monthly**
     - **Biweekly**
     - **Weekly**
     - **Semi-Monthly**

4. **EMI Calculation**:
   - Depending on the user's choice, the program calculates the EMI for the selected frequency. It uses the principal amount, annual interest rate, and loan tenure to derive the periodic payments.
   - It offers detailed payment schedules, breaking down each payment into interest and principal components, and showing the remaining principal after each payment.

5. **Loan Tenure Calculation**:
   - For users who know their EMI and need to determine the loan tenure, the program calculates the approximate number of years required to repay the loan based on the provided EMI and payment frequency.

### Detailed Walkthrough

1. **Monthly EMI Calculation**:
   - Inputs: Principal, Annual Interest Rate, Loan Tenure in Years.
   - Outputs: Monthly EMI and a detailed payment schedule.

2. **Biweekly EMI Calculation**:
   - Inputs: Principal, Annual Interest Rate, Loan Tenure in Years.
   - Outputs: Biweekly EMI and a detailed payment schedule.

3. **Weekly EMI Calculation**:
   - Inputs: Principal, Annual Interest Rate, Loan Tenure in Years.
   - Outputs: Weekly EMI and a detailed payment schedule.

4. **Semi-Monthly EMI Calculation**:
   - Inputs: Principal, Annual Interest Rate, Loan Tenure in Years.
   - Outputs: Semi-Monthly EMI and a detailed payment schedule.

5. **Loan Tenure Based on EMI**:
   - Inputs: Principal, Annual Interest Rate, Payment Amount (EMI), Payment Frequency.
   - Outputs: Approximate loan tenure in years.

### How It Works

- **EMI Calculation Formula**:
  The EMI is calculated using the formula:
  
  EMI = [ P * r * (1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

  
  Where:
  - (P) = Principal loan amount
  - (r) = Periodic interest rate
  - (n) = Number of payments

- **Payment Schedule**:
  Each payment schedule details the interest and principal components of each payment, helping users track how much of their payment goes towards interest and how much towards reducing the principal.

### Conclusion

This **LoanCalculator** project is a powerful tool for anyone needing to understand their loan repayment obligations. It supports various payment frequencies and provides detailed insights into both the amount and schedule of payments. Whether you are planning to take a loan or managing an existing one, this project will help you make informed financial decisions.
